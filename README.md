# Avalanche
A quick project based on an old flash game of the same name.

A runnable build can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/9asutxy761cx6c3/Avalanche%20v1.zip

Controls: left/right arrows to move, up (or space) to jump, and left ctrl to go slow-mo.

The goal is to climb as high as you can up the falling blocks without getting squished or caught by the rising water. The slow-mo can be used to allow you to climb up difficult spots, but while it slows the falling blocks it actually speeds up the rising water, so you have to be careful with how much you use it.
